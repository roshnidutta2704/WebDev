                <h2 class="article-title">Why Do We Remember Some Dreams and Forget Others?</h2>
                <p class="author">By Emilia Hartley</p>
                <p class="publication-date">Published on October 9, 2022</p>
                <p class="summary">Every night, we dream—sometimes vividly, sometimes not at all. But why do some dreams
                    stay with us while others slip away the moment we wake up? This article explores the science of
                    dream recall, including the roles played by REM sleep, the hippocampus, and the emotional content of
                    dreams. It also dives into the psychological theories behind dream memory, such as Freud's ideas
                    about repression and modern views linking dream vividness to neurotransmitter activity. With
                    insights from neuroscience and cognitive psychology, this piece unpacks why some dreams leave a
                    lasting imprint while others dissolve before we even open our eyes.</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">How Iceland Is Redefining Sustainable Tourism</h2>
                <p class="author">By Dr. Leena Vyas</p>
                <p class="publication-date">Published on February 18, 2024</p>
                <p class="summary">Iceland has emerged as a global leader not just in natural beauty but also in
                    responsible tourism. This article explores how the country has managed the tension between increased
                    tourist traffic and environmental preservation. From limiting access to vulnerable areas like
                    Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon to implementing green energy solutions powered by geothermal and hydroelectric
                    sources, Iceland is creating a model for sustainable travel. It also covers initiatives like the
                    “Pledge for Nature” and how local communities are engaged in protecting Iceland's delicate
                    ecosystems. Perfect for eco-conscious travelers and environmental advocates, this article showcases
                    how tourism and sustainability can go hand-in-hand.</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">The Rise of Cottagecore: Escapism, Aesthetics, and Internet Subcultures</h2>
                <p class="author">By Arjun Mehta</p>
                <p class="publication-date">Published on June 3, 2023</p>
                <p class="summary">Cottagecore is more than just pretty pictures of flower fields and vintage
                    teacups—it's a full-blown cultural movement. Born on Tumblr and flourishing on TikTok and Instagram,
                    cottagecore idealizes rural life, home crafts, and a return to nature. But beneath the surface of
                    cozy aesthetics lies a deeper craving for simplicity and escape from fast-paced, digitally saturated
                    lives. This article delves into the roots of cottagecore, its ties to gender expression and LGBTQ+
                    identity, and how it served as a comforting digital refuge during the pandemic. It also examines
                    critiques of the trend, including its potential to romanticize privilege and overlook the realities
                    of rural labor.</p>
